This script generates a plot that gives a visual representation of some features (i.e., number of analysed cancer samples per publication) from the scientific publications found on the Progenetix publication collection. 

__Output of basic_world_map.py:__

![alt text](images/basic_world_map.png)

This script generates a simple world map using the Basemap package and can be used as a starting point to create more complex plots.

__Output of geoloc_animation.py:__

This script generates an animation that displays the location of the analysed tumor samples across the years and can be used to get an idea of the tumor sample distribution around the world.
