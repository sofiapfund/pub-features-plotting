## Progenetix publication collection: which scientific publications are relevant?


The Progenetix publication collection contains articles describing whole genome screening (WGS, WES, aCGH, cCGH) experiments in cancer. Genomic information about the analyzed cancer samples is extracted from these publications to generate cancer mutation data, with a focus on copy number abnormalities (CNV / CNA). 


Data from a scientific publication is included in the Progenetix publication collection if the following __three main criteria__ are fulfilled:
1. Data was obtained from a __human tumor sample__
2. Data represents the tumor at a __whole-genome level__
3. Data is accessible for __download__


The table below summarizes which genome sequencing technologies generally offer relevant tumor sample data for the Progenetix web resource, and which ones don't:


Relevant technologies | Non-relevant technologies
------------ | -------------
whole-genome sequencing  |  targeted genome-sequencing
whole-exome sequencing  | gene expression arrays
genomic arrays (cCGH, aCGH) | tissue microarrays


Note that, despite containing data about tumor samples at a whole-genome level, some publications might still not be relevant for the Progenetix publication collection. 
Examples of such publications are:
* publications that report previously presented data (e.g. reviews, technical publications, ...)
* publications with data that from _in vitro_ experiments
* publications with tumor data obtained from animal models
