## Progenetix Publication Collection: which scientific publications are relevant?

The Progenetix database provides an overview of mutation data in cancer, with a focus on copy number abnormalities (CNV / CNA), for all types of human malignancies. 

For this reason... 

Interest: copy-number changes in tumor samples. For this, data obtained with whole-genome technologies is required. 


In short, data in the publication must fulfill __three__ main criteria in order to be relevant:
1. it must be obtained from a human tumor sample (not germline sample)
2. it must represent the tumor at a whole-genome level
3. it must be accessible for download


The table below summarizes which sequencing technologies generally offer relevant tumor sample data for the Progenetix web resource.


Relevant technologies | Non-relevant technologies
------------ | -------------
whole-genome sequencing of __cancer__ samples  |  targeted genome-sequencing
whole-exome sequencing of __cancer__ samples  | expression arrays
genomic arrays (cCGH or aCGH) on __cancer__ samples | tissue microarrays


Note: previously presented data (e.g., data reported in reviews), data from _in vitro_ experiments and data from non-human samples (e.g., data obtained from animal models) are __not__ relevant.
